        "\n",
        "ANSWER : ```python\n",
        "assert spam >= 0, \"spam should not be a negative integer\"\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "This assertion:\n",
        "- Checks if `spam` is greater than or equal to 0\n",
        "- Raises an AssertionError with the specified message if the condition is False\n",
        "- Works for both integers and floats (will fail for negative numbers of either type)\n",
        "- Example failure: `spam = -5` would raise the error\n",

        "ANSWER : ```python\n",
        "assert False, \"This assertion always fails\"\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "This will:\n",

        "## 4. **What are the two lines that must be present in your software in order to call logging.debug()?**\n",
        "\n",
        "ANSWER : ```python\n",
        "import logging\n",
        "logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "These lines:\n",
        "1. Import the logging module\n",
        "2. Configure the basic logging system to show DEBUG level messages\n",
        "Without setting the level to DEBUG, debug messages won't be displayed (default level is WARNING)\n",
        "\n",
        "## 5. **What are the two lines that your program must have in order to have logging.debug() send a logging message to a file named programLog.txt?**\n",
        "\n",
        "ANSWER : ```python\n",
        "import logging\n",
        "logging.basicConfig(filename='programLog.txt', level=logging.DEBUG)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "These lines:\n",
        "1. Import the logging module\n",
        "2. Configure logging to write to 'programLog.txt' and accept DEBUG level messages\n",
        "The file will be created if it doesn't exist and appended to if it does\n",
        "\n",
        "## 6. **What are the five levels of logging?**\n",
        "\n",
        "ANSWER : From lowest to highest severity:\n",
        "1. **DEBUG**: Detailed information for diagnosing problems\n",
        "2. **INFO**: Confirmation that things are working as expected\n",
        "3. **WARNING**: Indication that something unexpected happened (but software still works)\n",
        "4. **ERROR**: Serious problem, software couldn't perform some function\n",
        "5. **CRITICAL**: Fatal error, program may be unable to continue running\n",
        "\n",
        "## 7. **What line of code would you add to your software to disable all logging messages?**\n",
        "\n",
        "ANSWER : ```python\n",
        "logging.disable(logging.CRITICAL)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "This:\n",
        "- Disables all logging messages at CRITICAL level and below\n",
        "- Effectively silences all logging since CRITICAL is the highest level\n",
        "- Can be reversed with `logging.disable(logging.NOTSET)`\n",
        "\n",
        "## 8. **Why is using logging messages better than using print() to display the same message?**\n",
        "\n",
        "ANSWER  : Advantages of logging over print():\n",
        "1. **Severity levels**: Different importance levels for messages\n",
        "2. **Selective output**: Can configure which messages to display\n",
        "3. **Multiple destinations**: Can log to files, network, console simultaneously\n",
        "4. **Metadata**: Includes timestamps, module names, line numbers automatically\n",
        "5. **Performance**: Can disable logging in production without removing code\n",
        "6. **Thread safety**: Logging is thread-safe, print() isn't guaranteed to be\n",
        "7. **Persistence**: Log files provide a permanent record\n",
        "8. **Formatting**: Consistent, configurable message formatting\n",
        "\n",
        "## 9. **What are the differences between the Step Over, Step In, and Step Out buttons in the debugger?**\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "ANSWER : **Step Over (next)**\n",
        "- Executes the current line of code\n",
        "- If the line contains a function call, executes the entire function without stepping into it\n",
        "- Moves to the next line in the current function\n",
        "\n",
        "**Step Into**\n",
        "- Executes the current line of code\n",
        "- If the line contains a function call, enters that function and pauses at its first line\n",
        "- Allows debugging inside called functions\n",
        "\n",
        "**Step Out (return)**\n",
        "- Executes the remaining lines of the current function\n",
        "- Pauses at the line after the function call in the calling function\n",
        "- Useful when you want to finish debugging the current function quickly\n",
        "\n",
        "## 10. **After you click Continue, when will the debugger stop?**\n",
        "\n",
        "ANSWER : After clicking Continue (or Run), the debugger will:\n",
        "1. Resume normal execution of the program\n",
        "2. Continue until one of these occurs:\n",
        "   - A breakpoint is encountered\n",
        "   - The program terminates (normally or with an error)\n",
        "   - A manually triggered pause occurs (if supported by the IDE)\n",
        "   - An unhandled exception occurs (if configured to break on exceptions)\n",
        "\n",
        "## 11. **What is the concept of a breakpoint?**\n",
        "\n",
        "ANSWER : A breakpoint is:\n",
        "- An intentional stopping or pausing place in a program\n",
        "- Set by the developer in a debugger\n",
        "- When execution reaches a breakpoint:\n",
        "  - The program pauses\n",
        "  - The debugger shows the current state (variables, call stack, etc.)\n",
        "  - Allows for step-by-step execution from that point\n",
        "- Types of breakpoints:\n",
        "  - Line breakpoints (most common)\n",
        "  - Conditional breakpoints (only trigger under certain conditions)\n",
        "  - Exception breakpoints (trigger on specific exceptions)\n",
        "  - Function breakpoints (trigger when a function is called)\n",
        "- Used to examine program state and flow during debugging"
